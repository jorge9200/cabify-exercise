# Cabify exercise

## Instructions

- Run `npm install` to install all necessary modules
- Run `npm start` to to run the exercise on localhost and test the presentation logic
- Run `npm test` to run the tests where Checkout is instanced and used by `scan()` and `total()` methods

## Extra

The product details modal has been developed. It can be tested clicking on product images or titles. For its implementation `index.css` has been updated.

A `Checkout.js` component was added on `/src/extra` folder. It is an alternative solution without an instantiable class using only React hooks. It is fully implemented and can be used to run the presentation logic.
